## Hadoop Decomp v1.0.0

It is a small framework, to make some sequences of operations on huge matrix matrix. 

## How to

* The project uses [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
* To generate idea project just use `sbt idea-gen`
* Generate "fat jar" only once (to keep there all dependencies) `sbt assembly`. You should re-build this jar: the project uses impressive [NoJarTool](https://github.com/ktoso/hadoop-scalding-nojartool)
